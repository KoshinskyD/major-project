# Project Reflection

## Favourite Parts
I am happy that I was able to finish my need to have list however I feel that this game is still lacking in many ways and is far from complete. There are many changes I would make if I had the time and much more I had hoped to add but simply did not have the time for.

## Most challenging parts
- Inventory
- Item Drops

## Changes if I had more time
- Add an attack animation
- Rework movement
- Rework Attacking
- Better allign the player when the game starts 
- Move item drops out of the enemies class
- Make a nicer start screen and a nicer death screen
- Inprove the scaling so it works better on all screens
- Use a loop for all of the preloading
- Use a loop in the setup function for setting map values
