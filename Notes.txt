// Current version is broken due to scaling of the sprite with
// screen size as it somehow messed with hitbox detection more 
// than it should have in my mind.
// When I draw the hitboxes they do not colide yet it acts like 
// they do. I am not sure why this is happening however I need
// to take a break from this for a while

// 9:15/21/9/2020
// The collision still does not line up.
// I have no idea why however I found a number that works. 
// I plan to move on today and maybe add sounds
// Moved this over from the code so it has it own document and
// is not taking up space as a giant comment.

// 11:15/21/9/2020
// My issue with collision was caused by rectMode and imageMode.
// Currently collision works as intended and there are no issues 
// that I see I plan on adding Background music tomorrow. I have
// a few Ideas for what to add but have not deciced and I have
// no clue how to do it yet. I have also added a death screen.

// 9:25/22/2020
// I am going to wait on music for now as I havent found a good
// song for the background. Going to use the background 
// selection/stitching for extra for experts probably. I was
// tempted to add enemies today but I will wait as I will
// probably learn a good way to do it soon rather than just
// hacking it togeather poorly

// 10:20/22//2020
// Handed in interactive scene. My current idea for this game is
// have a set amount of enemies per area and gain power(damage,
// defense, hp) for every enemy killed. After a set amount of 
// areas/stages there will be a boss fight. this fight is always
// accesable but will be near impossible if you go there with no
// power ups.

// 11:26/25/9/2020
// Mouse running in our class, fun times. Started working on 
// enemies. Also Trying to rework sprite animations as it is
// not the best now. Tried using framecount but I will probably
// switch to millis() as it seems better and there are issues 
// with how I used framecount.

// 1/10/2020
// Changed how sprites switch but I am still using framecount.

// 10:49/2/10/2020
// Creating a player class. Mostly working but I am getting
// errors with displaying my sprite.

// 11:42/2/10/2020
// Fixed errors with displaying char sprite and got enemies
// working mostly. Hitboxes are not that good but they work as a
// proof of concept and it is fun just trying to dodge them. I
// plan to add attacks for the player tonight or tomorrow and
// then an inventory for the player. I will use this inventory
// for my 2d array project.

// 10:22/5/10/2020
// Started work on inventory.

// 11:43/5/10/2020
// Mostly finished sidebar. Need to work on inventory position.
// Currently the inventory array is filled with random values to
// make it so i can display it.
// Using numbers based on a sidebar of 300 width.

// 10:24/6/10/2020
// deciced to completly redo the sidebar math and set the
// screen to a ratio of 2:1 with:height. Hopefully this makes
// things easier. Game is working properly on a screensize of 
// 1578 x 789. Remember to comment the sidebar class its a mess.

// 11:15/6/10/2020
// Got Sidebar to scale based around a height of 789. It isn't
// pretty but it works. To tired to comment so I will start to
// add attacking.

// 11:43/6/10/2020
// Working on deleting enemies if health = 0
// hit detection is not working at all.

// 11:02/7/10/2020
// Hit detection is working, I forgot to add a perentheses. I
// now plan to add weapons and finish the inventory
// Please comment the code sometime soon its getting hard to 
// read.

// 11:34/8/10/2020
// I have added Weapons. They do not drop but they do work. My
// plans for the rest of the day is to redo the attack function
// and put it into a mouse pressed function. I still need to
// comment my code but I did make parts of it slightly more
// readable. Where there are colours in the weapons I plan to 
// put sprites for each weapon.

// 11:15/9/10/2020
// I have added health potions and they work and I am happy. I
// Still need to add textures and more items but they work. You
// get a better sword based on how many enemies you kill. They
// also need textures. I need to make an attacking animation of
// some sort and I plan on adding sheild consumables (thanks for
// the idea talapia fish). I am now working on dragging of items
// and switching their location. Added damage potions so I have
// different items to use/move.

// 11:40/9/10/2020
// Waiting until the weekend to add item dragging. I am tired
// and there is not enough time to get into it now. I also want
// to add a display that shows up when you hover over the item.
// This display should show basic info about the item such as 
// what this item does.


// 18:55/12/10/2020
// Husky from the pubhalls discord server has been helping a lot
// and has given me examples and pointed me in the right 
// direction lots. I am currently finishing the inventory so
// that when you drag an item it switches places. After that I
// think that I should be done my 2d array project.

// 11:36/12/10/2020
// Dragging is not working for bottom row. Ask schellenberg
// about it tomorrow at school. I am at a loss for what is 
// working and it is late so I am going to sleep.

// 10:07/13/2020
// I was dumb and had the wrong values being used. Everything 
// works as intended now. Adding a few weapon and I will look
// for some sprites for them. 

// 11:35/13/2020
// Working on displaying a text box with item info when you
// hover over it.
